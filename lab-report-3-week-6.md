# WEEK 6 LAB REPORT

## Streamlining ssh Configuration

The `ssh/config` file that is shown below is edited using VSCode. I opened the `.ssh` file on VSCode and added the new file called `config` and copy pasted the lines.

As the image below dipicts, I logged into my account by using the `ssh ieng6` command where my alias is ieng6.

To add a file to my account, I used the `scp` command. I made a new text file called `empty.txt` in my Downloads and then copied it to my ieng account with `scp`. I logged in and used the `ls` command to see if it copied.
